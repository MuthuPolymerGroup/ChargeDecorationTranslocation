Sample files for executing simulation for the DNA translocation through RL2 mutant version of the alpha-hemolysin pore as described in the reference (jou_muthukumar_2017)

1. LangevinDynamics: Simulation was performed using LAMMPS [1]. in.sim and trans45.dat are the input files for the lammps. log.lammps and dump45.xyz are the output files generated. The conformation and the position of the dna as a function of time is tracked through the dump45.xyz file.

2. PNP: PNP code can be downloaded from:  http://thallium.bsd.uchicago.edu/RouxLab/sub/method/pbpnp.html [2]
The input files are: input.in and dna_positions_1.dat
output file is logs.dat which generates potential across the nanopore and the ionic current.
